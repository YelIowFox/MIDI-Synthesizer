# MIDI-Synthesizer
Transforming old synthesizer into MIDI device

**Version 1.0.0**

At this stage the MIDI device 5 din connector doesn't work therefore the Serial-MIDI bridge can't be done,  the solution for this problem at the moment is a emulated Serial-MIDI bridge. For this I included two simple applications.  One for the virtual MIDI In/Out and one for the Serial-MIDI bridge.
